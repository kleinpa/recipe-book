Batch mix dry ingredients:

\begin{ingredients}
\ingredientAlt{205}{g}{7.25}{oz}{instant beans}
\ingredient{157}{g}{instant rice}
\ingredient{22}{g}{taco seasoning}
\end{ingredients}

\SI{100}{g} of the dry mix makes a small meal. Rehydrate by adding boiling water a bit above the level of the mix and letting sit, covered, for 5 minutes.

Serve with fritos, salsa, cheese, a tortilla, hot sauce or anything else.
