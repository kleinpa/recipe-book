\recipe{Crusty White Bread}

This is my `baseline' same-day bread with just the traditional four ingredients. It can be made as a boule, loaf, or even pizza crust.

At the same time, combine remaining water with flour and mix until dough forms, let set for 15 minutes.

Combine yeast mixture with dough and add salt. Knead in stand mixer until smooth and elastic, about 7 minutes.

Cover and let rise for 120 minutes total.
At 30 minutes, fold dough twice.
At 120 minutes, fold dough twice carefully.

At this point the dough is done with it's first rise and is ready to be shaped into its final form.

\recipesection{Dutch Oven Boule}

Place on a floured work surface and let rest for 5 minute. Shape the slack dough into a ball by folding the edges up and in on itself, putting a slight tension on the entire surface. Transfer back to a bowl, seam side up. Cover and let rise in a cool place for 60-90 minutes.

Preheat oven with dutch oven to \SI{500}{°F}. Drop boule into dutch oven, cover, and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce temp to \SI{450}{°F} and bake for 15 minutes. Uncover and bake for a final 15-20 minutes.
