Cook pasta the usual way in a pot. When done, reserve some of the cooking water for use later.

\begin{ingredients}
\ingredientAlt{1/2}{lb}{225}{g}{spaghetti (in \SI{2.5}{L} water)}
\ingredient{1}{tbsp}{salt}
\end{ingredients}

Cut meat into \SI{1/4}{inch} pieces. 5 minutes after pasta has started, add meat, oil, and red pepper flakes to the skillet and cook until bacon is done.

\begin{ingredients}
\ingredientAlt{1/2}{lb}{226}{g}{bacon}
\ingredient{1.5}{tbsp}{olive oil}
\ingredient{}{some}{red pepper flakes}
\end{ingredients}

Prepare sauce by whisking together eggs, cheese, and pepper.

\begin{ingredients}
\ingredient{3}{}{egg yolks}
\ingredient{1}{}{egg}
\ingredient{20}{g}{parmesan, grated}
\ingredient{1/2}{tsp}{black pepper}
\end{ingredients}

Once pasta is done and bacon is cooked, transfer pasta to skillet and toss to coat with fat. Let cool for a minute then transfer back to the hot drained pot. Add sauce mixture to pot while stirring continuously until the sauce thickens. Serve immediately.

Note: The eggs must be tempered and not curdled so the egg mixture must be heated uniformly to keep the temperature below \SI{145}{°F}, never exceeding \SI{165}{°F}. The residual heat from the pasta and pot should be enough to make this happen, but if the sauce is still too runny a few tablespoons of hot pasta water can be added.
